    "# Introduction to the MovieLens Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "[MovieLens](http://www.movielens.org/) is a website where users submit ratings for movies that they watch and receive recommendations for movies (based on their ratings). The collected data is made [publicly available for research](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). We will be working with a data set of 1 million user ratings of movies. There are more recent data sets with more ratings, but these data sets do not contain demographic information about the users, which is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the data."
