    "The lyrics generated by my bigram model had a higher quality than those generated by the unigram model. However, this was by an extremely small margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In context, the artist \"Migos\" (who I did by lyrical analysis on) is known to have lyrics that contain countless forms of slang, profanity, and gramatical errors. For this reason, both models generated song lyrics that seemed not too far off from something Migos would write. This, however, made the outcome of the lyric generation more believable. As someone who listens to Migos regularly, I was able to recognize the bigram generation as being a bit more sensible as lyrics than the unigram generation because it made a tad more grammatical sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought the unigram was more advantageous than the bigram for the first word in each line. It had the option of all first line words while the bigram was restricted to options based on the last word of previous line. The bigram was more advantageous in the middle and end of lines, however, because it had the benefit of predicting words from the last two words, rather than just the last word. Additionally, I noticed the end of lines seemed more sensible in the bigram than the unigram, since the bigram was more accurate on which phrases/words end lines and songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I thought both models were able to produce reasonable lyrics for Migos, due to Migos natural sense of slang and bad grammar."
